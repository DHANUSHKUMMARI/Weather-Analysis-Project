# 🌦 Weather Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
The **Weather Analysis Project** provides deep insights into global weather conditions using **Power BI** and **Excel** reports. It includes detailed visualizations and trend analyses of various weather parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and extreme weather events.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationship between **humidity, temperature, pressure, wind speed, and direction**.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies unusually high or low humidity levels indicating abnormal weather conditions.
- **Trend Analysis**: Examines frequency and patterns of specific weather conditions over time.
- **Extreme Weather Detection**: Recognizes conditions like storms, hail, and hurricanes.
- **Urban Planning Insights**: Assesses wind direction and its impact on pollution dispersion in cities.
- **Climate Change Analysis**: Studies long-term temperature trends to evaluate global warming effects.
- **Seasonality Patterns**: Determines how seasonal temperature variations affect ecosystems.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Identifies countries with the highest number of cities for weather insights.
- **Heatwaves & Cold Analysis**: Helps in predicting extreme temperature events for disaster management.

## 📊 Reports & Visualizations
- **Power BI Report**: Interactive analysis with charts and KPIs.
- **Excel Report**: Structured data analysis with summaries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Microsoft Power BI** (for data visualization)
- **Microsoft Excel** (for data analysis and visualisation)
- **SQL**(for extracting required data to excel based on the problem statement)
- **Data Sources**: Global weather datasets
